# django-address-box
This project uses Django and provides a backend for a simple application for a box of email addresses. As a user, you can add a new 
person with attached email addresses (and their types: 'private' or 'professional'). You can create groups among your 
contacts, add any contact to arbitrary many groups, and the like. The application also includes a browser for finding your
contacts by a phrase matching a contact's first or last name.
